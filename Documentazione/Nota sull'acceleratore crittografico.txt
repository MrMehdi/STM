NOTA SULL'ACCELERATORE CRITTOGRAFICO
CRYPT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)

Cryptographic acceleration (CRYP and HASH)
The devices embed a cryptographic processor that supports the advanced cryptographic
algorithms usually required to ensure confidentiality, authentication, data integrity and nonrepudiation when exchanging messages with a peer:

• Encryption/Decryption
	– DES/TDES (data encryption standard/triple data encryption standard): ECB
	(electronic codebook) and CBC (cipher block chaining) chaining algorithms, 64-,
	128- or 192-bit key
	
	– AES (advanced encryption standard): ECB, CBC, GCM, CCM, and CTR (Counter
	mode) chaining algorithms, 128, 192 or 256-bit key
• Universal HASH
	– SHA-1 and SHA-2 (secure HASH algorithms)
	– MD5
	– HMAC
	
The cryptographic accelerator supports DMA request generation.
